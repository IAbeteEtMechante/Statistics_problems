# Statistics questions and answers

Grab a question about statistics, then look up the answer if needed.


## Random Question Generator
### Installation

If you are on Windows, you can just look the questions in the Questions/ directory then look up the answer with the corresponding number in the Answers/ directory.

If you are on UNIX/MacOS, I added a random question generator in Bash.

Here is how to use that Bash script for UNIX/MacOS:
* Run the following commands to install shotwell to view images on your machine:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install shotwell-common
```

* Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/IAbeteEtMechante/Statistics_problems.git
```

* Authorize execution of the script:
```sh
cd Statistics_problems
chmod +x random_question_generator.sh
```
### Use the Script

* Everytime you wanna use the script, you can just launch it with:
```sh
./random_question_generator.sh
```
## Usefull links

These links are quite usefull in my opinion to calculate and visualize p-values and confidence intervals for normal, Student t and Chi Square distributions:
