1/ you should first remember that the MLE of mu 
is the sample mean

(it is proven in another question, by finding the mu for whihc the gradient of the likelyhood funciton is equal to zero...which is the sample mean)

2/ use invariant property of MLE in general. MLE of theta **2 is theta^ **2 where theta^ is the MLE of theta.
