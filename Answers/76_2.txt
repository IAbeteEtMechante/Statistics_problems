diagnostic:

1/we test the null hypothesis with a chi-square test:

df = 399 - 394 = 5
chi_square_critical = 11.07 (from a chi sqaure table)
chisuare = 499.98 - 458.52 = 41.346
we can reject null hypothesis
The model is a good fit here.

AIC is another mesaure of how good the model fit

2/ write the equation:

admission = -3.98 + 0.002 (gre) + 0.804 (gpa) -0.675(rank2) - 1.340 (rank3) - 1.55 (rank4) 

3/ to check the importance of rank2, rank3, rank4
we can do it by hand, take them out and look if good fit or not
or we can use R and perform a wald test(see next pictures)
In wald test, we group together Terms= 4:6   (to group rank2, rank3 and rank4).

nobody looks at z value and p value for intercept

here is the code in R:

#need to tell R that "rank" is a categorical variable so that it knows it has to create dummy variables
binary$rank = factor(binary$rank) 
mylogit <- glm(admit ~ gre + gpa + rank, data = binary, family = binomial)
summary(mylogit)


library(aod)
library(ggplot2)
wald.test(b = coef(mylogit), Sigma = vcov(mylogit), Terms = 4:6)
