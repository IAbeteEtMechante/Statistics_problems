Be careful
you have to notice that the two sample are NOT independant
they are paired. So we have to do a PAIRED t-test


no need to take the square of sd for the calculations
step 1: set up hypotesis
setp2: choose level of significance
alpha = 0.05
df = 8
-> t_critical = 2.306 (easy to find with an online calculator, see next picture)

step 3: calculate our t value:
4.375 / (1.685 / sqrt(8))  = 7.34 > 2.36 so we reject the NULL hypothesis. 
conclusion:
our p-value is very small 0.00008,and our t-score is higher than the critical t-score
Therefore we reject NULL hypothesis.
Data support hypothesis that the population mean reading test score for slow learners taught by the new method is greater than the mean reading test score for those taught by the standard method.
