Say we have a population of 30 students and we want to know the parameter mu = "mean number of siblings" of the population.

We ask the question to 10 students. And here are the answers we get:
(3,0,2,1,3,2,1,0,2,1)


The way we proceed, is that we ASSUME that we know the form of the distribution of number of siblings per student in the population.
For example, in that case, we would probably assume it is a Poisson.
But for the sake of the example, let us assume, that we think the distribution 
of number of siblings has the following shape:

P(X = 0) =  2 * Θ/3
P(X = 1) =  Θ/3
P(X = 2) =  2 * (1 - Θ)/3
P(X = 3) =  (1 - Θ)/3

where Θ is an unknown parameter.
Notice that the word parameter here is used for two somewhat different things.

Θ is a parameter in the sense of parameter of a function (the distribution)
Mu is a parameter of the population in the sense of statistics.
It turns out theta can also be seen as a parameter of the population in the sense of statistics (in my personal opinion).

Given our assumption of the form of the distribution, we have the following relation

mu = E(X) = 1*Θ/3 + 2 * 2(1-Θ)/3 + 3 * (1-Θ)/3 = 7/3 - 2 * Θ

More generally speaking, the parameter we want to estimate will be a 
function of the parameter(s) that parametrize the distribution we assumed

   mu = t(Θ) = 7/3 - 2 * Θ

And our goal will be to get a sample (x1,x2,....xn), and to use it to estimate Θ, and then we will estimate mu as well.
We can use several methods to estimate Θ given the sample (x1,x2,....xn).
Two commons methods are method of moments, and maximum likelihood(more on that in other slides).

In a more general case, we could have more parameters Θ1, Θ2, etc....

	mu = t(Θ1, Θ2, ...)
