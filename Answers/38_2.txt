This is a little tricky

The sample variance itself is biased. 
But we know we can get an unbiased estimator of the variance by using the n/(n-1) correction.

But because the sqrt is not linear, the Sd is still biased(even after this correction of the variance estimator) and it is not possible to get an unbiased estimator of the sd (without knowing what the distribution looks like).
