1/we convert to Z

Z = (X-500)/100

we want z such as P(Z <= z ) = 0.9

we find the value z = 1.28 using the picture attached (11_2.png) (in blue on the picture, it is called x on the picture, but for us, it is called z)

finally the answer x to our problem is:

(x-500) /100 = z = 1.28
so x = 128 + 500 = 628
