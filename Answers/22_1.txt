We can think of 3 factors:
-level of confidence: more confidence -> bigger CI
-variability of data: more variability -> bigger CI
-sample size: bigger sample size -> smaller CI

(See picture 20_2.png)

Of course we want the smallest CI possible while at the same time we want the highest level of confidence possible.
