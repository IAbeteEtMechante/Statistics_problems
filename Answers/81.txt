the goal is to have a good model
but also to not have too many predictor variable which are not very usefull

if we had all the predictor variables under the sun, we will have a better fit, it will look better
But the truth is that you want as little predictor variables as possbile

how to do that?

we remove the predictor variables that dont seem to help (bas p-value) and see if our model is still good.
