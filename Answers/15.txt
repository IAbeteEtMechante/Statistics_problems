An estimator is a rule to estimate a given quantity based on future observed data.
The estimate is the actual value obtained by plugging an actual sample to this rule
The estimand is what we are trying to estimate.

For example:
If we try to estimate the mean age of a population of 1000 people.
We can use samples of size 10 to estimate it
our estimator will be to take the mean of 50 values of any sample

Now if we actually pull a sample [13, 41, 72, 35, 35,  7, 76, 33, 34, 32] from the population.
Our estimate is 37.8

Our estimand is the mean age of the population of 1000 people, and we still don't know it, we just have an estimate of it.


There can be point estimator and interval estimator. You should not put too much importance on point estimate. Interval estimator with confidence level are much more usefull.
