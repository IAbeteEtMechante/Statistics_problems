you can check with a goodness of fit test.

it is very simple

chi square test:

step 1: hypotehsis:

you just test the null hypothesis: all betas are equal to 0 (except the intercept)

step2: critical level

(deviance of null is number of observation minus 1, took out one for the intercept  =  n - 1)

(current deviance = n- 1 - k)

df = df(deviance of null) - df(current deviance) 
df = (n- 1) - (n- 1 -k) = k

we look at chi square df = k, find the chi_critical for alpha = 0.05. 

step3: calculate the statistics (chi square here):

chi_square =   deviance of null - current deviance 
(remember deviance big is bad = worse model)
(deviance is an indicator of how bad the model is)

4/ conclusion if chi_square > chisquare_critical: reject nULL, we have a good model.
