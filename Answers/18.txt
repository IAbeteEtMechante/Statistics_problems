the sampling distribution of a statistic is:
" a theorical distribution that shows the frequency of occurence of values of that statistic, computed for all possible samples of size N drawn for some population."

It is easier to think about it like that:
you have a population.
you choose a sample size N.
You choose a statistic, for example the mean.
You sample the population a million times, with samples of size N.
You take the mean of each of those samples.

The sampling distribution of the mean will be the distribution of those results.

(spoiler alert, it looks like a normal distriution for n>=30).
