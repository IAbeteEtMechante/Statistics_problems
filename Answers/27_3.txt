let us rephrase this for clarity.
First note that:
#########################################
 the MME will depend on the sample size:
  n
#########################################
for each parameter theta, 
theta_MME_n = f(x1,x2,....xn)
See how we indexed the estimator by n here.

It is an estimator, which gives an estimate depending on a sample (x1,...xn).
Remember the estimator is the litteral expresion and the estimate is the computed expression for a given sample.


1 / we have a sample of size n : x1, x2, x3, ...xn

2/ we also have a distribution, which shape is supposed known already. what is unknown is just one or more parameters of this distribution.
For example, if we assume we have a Gaussian, we need to find 2 parameters: mu and sigma.
If we assume we have an exponential, we just have to find one parameter lambda, etc...

3/ so we have K parameters unknowns for the distribution. we need to find K equations to determine those parameters.
for that we calculate the first K moments of the distribution in two ways:
first way: with the litteral expression of the distribution
second way: from the sample.


for each k in {1,2,3...K}, we equate those two ways of calculating moments:
E(X) = 1/n * (x1 +x2 +.... xn )    (1)
E(X^2) = 1/n * (x1^2 +x2^2 +.... xn^2 )    (2)
....
E(X^K) = 1/n * (x1^K +x2^K +.... xn^K )    (K)

we have (K) equations, so we can find the estimators of each of the K parameters of the distribution
